# AGENTS.md — "Belajar" (personal school + learning app)

Single-user private app: manage school assignments (PR) with deadlines/progress/checkpoints,
plus AI-assisted learning. UI text is Indonesian. The owner is a vocational high-school
software student; he directs, AI agents write most code. Explain new files briefly.

## Read first
- docs/SPEC.md (features, Supabase schema, AI route, build order)
- docs/DESIGN.md (visual rules, tokens). Reference: app/globals.css, components/Today.tsx.
If a task conflicts with these docs, STOP and ask.

## Stack
Next.js App Router + TypeScript (strict), plain CSS classes prefixed `rn-` in app/globals.css
(Tailwind is installed but do not rely on it for new components), Supabase later, Vercel.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` | `npm run build` | `npm run lint`. Run build + lint before every commit.

## Git
- Never commit to main. Branch per task: `agent/<short-task>`. Small commits, clear messages.
- Never commit secrets. `.env*.local` stays gitignored.

## Hard rules
1. TypeScript strict. No `any`, no `// @ts-ignore`. Fix type errors properly.
2. BORDERLESS design for content (no cards, boxes, shadows, glow, blur, glass). Interactive controls (buttons, chips, input fields) MAY use a 12px rounded box with clear hover/focus/active states. See docs/DESIGN.md.
3. Use existing CSS variables and `rn-` classes. No new colors. No decorative effects.
4. Video hujan HANYA di hero halaman Hari Ini (memudar ke latar polos saat scroll).
   Halaman lain berlatar polos. Tanpa aksara Jawa, tulisan Jawa, motif batik, atau kanji.
5. Keep ALL data access behind `lib/repo.ts` (mock now, Supabase later). Pages never call a DB directly.
6. Do NOT touch auth, RLS, Supabase config, env files, or API keys unless the task explicitly says so.
7. AI/API keys only on the server (route handlers). Never in client code.
8. No new dependencies without saying why first.
9. Mobile first (390px), touch targets >= 44px, respect prefers-reduced-motion.
10. Dates: real dynamic dates, Indonesian locale. No fake placeholder data in final UI.
11. Folder lib/ai/ dan app/api/ai/ adalah backend AI milik pemilik. JANGAN diubah, dihapus,
    atau dipindah. Jangan membuat file lib/ai.ts (bentrok dengan folder lib/ai/). Data
    contoh/mock ditaruh di lib/mock/. Kunci API tidak boleh muncul di kode klien.
    
## Model roles (Antigravity)
- Claude Sonnet: schema/RLS, auth, AI route, security review, tricky UI.
- Gemini Flash: repetitive CRUD, simple pages, refactors, fixing build/lint errors.
- Security-related work by any model must be reviewed by Claude before merging.

## Definition of done (every task)
Build + lint pass, matches docs/DESIGN.md checklist, summary of files changed/skipped/unsure.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
